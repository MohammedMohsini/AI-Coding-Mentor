# AI Coding Mentor

## Overview
AI Coding Mentor is an intelligent AI-powered assistant designed to help students learn programming faster by analyzing code, detecting errors, explaining mistakes, and teaching concepts interactively. Unlike traditional compilers or debuggers, this system focuses on understanding and learning, not just fixing errors.
